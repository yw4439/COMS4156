Bug and improves:

Course:
isCourseFull function should be return enrollmentCapacity <= enrolledStudentCount;

Department:
toString: improved to provide more information

RouteController:
Give every function in the class an update so they could handle null problems. (like null department)
findCourseTime when course find should return it time slot rather "some time"

IndividualProjectApplication:
All thing stay the same as asked

P.S. Some of the bug was fixed without noted
Fixed during first two steps and noticed that we need mark them down here :(
