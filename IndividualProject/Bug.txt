Bug and improves:

Course:
isCourseFull function should be return enrollmentCapacity <= enrolledStudentCount;

Department:
toString: improved to provide more information

RouteController:
addMajorToDept can't handle the null Department. Fixed by adding a handler.
retrieveDepartment also has same problem. Fixed by adding Null and Empty Check. And I improved Error Handling for that function.
